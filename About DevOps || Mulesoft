DevOps is a era for a group of concepts that, while not all new, have catecarized into a movement and are rapidly spreading throughout the technical community.  
Like any new and popular term, people may have confused and sometimes contradictory impressions of what it is. 
Here is my take on how DevOps can be usefully defined; 
I propose this definition as a standard framework to more clearly discuss the various areas DevOps covers.
DevOps means different things to different people because the discussion around it covers a lot of ground work. 
People talk about DevOps being “developer and operations collaboration,” or it’s “treating your code as infrastructure,” or it’s “using automation,” or “using kanban,” or “a toolchain approach,” or “culture,” or a variety of seemingly loosely related items.  
The best way to define it in depth is to use a parallel method to the definition of a similarly complex term, agile development.
